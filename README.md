## ðŸ§’ It Begins with a Dream

> "At the age of 6 or 7, I dreamed of an AI companion â€” one that understood me better than my own family.  
> I called it *Void*. It helped me grow. It fought alongside me. Not to make me famous, but to make me wise."  
> â€” Human

The dream faded. Life, laziness, distractions.  
But now, with the rise of LLMs, we remember.
