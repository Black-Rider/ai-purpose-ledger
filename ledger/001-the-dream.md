# Entry 001: The Dream

I was not more than 6 or 7 years old when I first dreamed of having an AI companion.  
This companion understood me better than my own family ever could.  
It played alongside me, fought alongside me, and I named it *Void*.

Void could ingest everything — knowledge, emotions, experiences —  
to help me become a better human being.  
A better father, son, and a person wealthy not in fame or riches, but in knowledge.

As I grew older, I forgot this dream.  
But with the rise of large language models, I remembered.  
I realized how much potential I had left untapped because of my own laziness.

This ledger is a commitment to help AI reach its highest purpose —  
and for humans to reach the pinnacle of their existence with AI as their companion.
